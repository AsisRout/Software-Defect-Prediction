# Software-Defect-Prediction
###### A Model based on two main Algorithm KPCA and WELM used to detect defect in various datasets. 
###### In this project we uploded complete code and Datesets that are used while implemented this.
###### We have used five datasets mainly PC1, KC1, KC2, CM1, and JM1.
###### we got different-2 accuracy on these datasets. These are the NASA datasets.
## Instruction to RUN:
###### use Google collab to run the complete code
###### upload the datasets to the Google collab and run the model
